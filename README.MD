# CS320 Software Testing

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensurnance of function and security can be guaranteed with testing. Frequent and thorough testing, be it Unit testing or Integration testing, can make sure that the software I write will be within specifications for function and security. Test coverage can also give us a percentage of how well our tests cover all of the code written. Making sure all our tests pass while keeping the test coverage as high as possible is what gives us this guarantee of function and security.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I try to have as much of a data oriented approach as possible when getting user needs and interpereting them. A majority of the time a user's needs should be possible to map out and implement into a data format that can be manipulated. I always take into account how the user says what they want as there can be small details that could be missed. Those small details could be the difference between meeting the user's requrements and not.

## How do I approach designing software?

My approach is to keep software as dry as possible while being efficient and optimized. I like to keep a map of how I imagine the software will look and follow that as closely as possible. Keeping a strict rigid regimin and roadmap of my projects will always be useful in every project going forward. These projects helped reinforce that mindset and style since the requirements were pretty rigid in it of themselves.
